- Create a local web app to help a user to choose what to have for dinner.

- Only one source file.

- local Vanilla.JS - no server-side code or frameworks.

- Should work well on a desktop or phone display. Phone-first, tho.

- Do not explain the code.
- Do not ask questions.
- If something is ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption and proceed.


## Main screen 

# Components:
- The dynamic display of the selected meal, along with a control to start the process. Think slot machine

Some On/Off toggles to control the spin:
- Need ingredients: in a separate edit-meal page a user is able to choose whether the necessary ingrediants are present.
- Pizza: are we just selecting pizza? In the meal editor there is an "is pizza" toggle
- Lake:  are we at the Lake? In the meal editor there is a "For Lake" toggle to show that a meal is good at the lake

- A button to bring up a (not needed yet) "edit meals" dialog.
  
## Edit meals

- Basically a scrolling list with "add", "delete", "edit", and "done" buttons

- Each list item contains:
  - Meal Name (string)
  - Ingredents on-hand (bool)
  - IsPizza? (bool)
  - ForLake? (bool)
  
The boolean items are independent of one another.
